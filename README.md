okdice
---

okdice is a platform for client side enhancements to the kDice strategy game hosted at http://kdice.com


How it works
--

The windows.okdice object exposes an api to the UI elements and actions a user performs in the browser


    okdice.say('I love brown shoes.');

    okdice.flag('brown');

    okdice.endTurn();

    okdice.sitIn('tablename');


A few more complicated widgets and features have been built, such as:

* Chat Buttons that speak common phrases at the click of a button
* Flag buttons that state your flag by clicking on the appropriate color
